Alright, I need to optimize the given code. Let me look at the original declaration.

The module declares a function jazzicon that returns an SVGSVGElement. The function parameters are diameter as a number and seed which can be a number or an array of numbers.

I notice that in TypeScript, when exporting functions, combining the type definition and export can make the code cleaner. So instead of declaring a separate function and then exporting it, I can export the function directly with its type.

So I'll change 'declare module' to 'export declare module' to ensure it's properly exported. Then, I'll move the function inside the module declaration without declaring it separately. This way, everything is concise and follows best practices for TypeScript modules.

The optimized code should have fewer lines while maintaining functionality.

export declare module '@neritapp/jazzicon' {
  const jazzicon: (diameter: number, seed: number | number[]) => SVGSVGElement;
  export default jazzicon;
}
