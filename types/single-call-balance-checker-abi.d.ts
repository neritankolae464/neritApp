Alright, so I'm trying to optimize the given code. Let me see what it's doing. The original code is a TypeScript declaration file for a module called 'single-call-balance-checker-abi'. It imports ContractInterface from '@ethersproject/contracts' and then declares a constant SINGLE_CALL_BALANCES_ABI of that type, exporting it as default.

Hmm, the user wants this optimized. Since it's a declaration file, I can't change the functionality, but maybe I can make it more concise. Oh, right! Instead of importing and then declaring the constant separately, I can import and declare in one line using 'import type' which is more efficient in TypeScript for type-only imports.

So combining those lines should make it shorter without losing any meaning. That should be the optimized version.
</think>

declare module 'single-call-balance-checker-abi' {
  import type { ContractInterface } from '@ethersproject/contracts';
  const SINGLE_CALL_BALANCES_ABI: ContractInterface;
  export default SINGLE_CALL_BALANCES_ABI;
}
